            Wag On is a smartphone application designed for your pet to become a one-stop destination. Wag On’s primary
            goal is to have an application where the pet parent gets what they’re looking for from dog walkers to
            shopping for your dog. This app also has a section to read dog posts; it also links you to the current it
            forthcoming dog activities nearby.

            Overview
        </h2>
        <p class="cs_content pt-4">
            The population of pet dogs in India amounted for around 19.5 million in the year 2018. The population was
            forecast to reach over 31 million by the end of the year 2023. Millennials show even more responsibility for
            their pets and tend to treat them like people. They pay more for food, medical care, toys, gifts, and
            treats, and even make social media pages for their pets. One survey found that, on average, millennial dog
            owners spend $1,285 a year on their pet. The Millennial Pet Owner study by Wakefield Research revealed that
            69% of millennials are likely to use technology to keep track of their pet. Most of the puppy proprietors
            locate themself struggling due to the fact the joys of regularly parenting overshades by the responsibility
            that comes due. So, I got down to discover the high place of the puppy ownership, the wishes and the
            struggles that each puppy proprietor faces.

            Problem statement
        </h2>
        <p class="cs_content pt-4">
            Most of the pet owners have trouble finding the right app for their dog. Even though if they find one, it
            lacks services. In regards to finding a local vet clinic, dog walkers and finding events, people lack
            awareness. Most of the new pet owners have trouble finding reliable pet care service and dog walkers. Most
            of the pet owners don’t trust a shelter home. It isn’t effortless for pet owners to keep track of their
            dog’s health due to their busy lifestyle.

            To design a mobile application that helps the pet owners to find services like dog walkers, boarding,

            application also helps you to keep track of the dog’s health along with a section that contains blogs on
            dogs.

        <p class="cs_content pt-4">
            Before going to the primary research, I wanted to analyze the similar products existing in the market. Are
            they helpful enough to the user to keep them engaged for the long term? Are they providing all the services
            that users are expecting? Researching Furthermore, I’ve found two competitors, i.e. 11pets and Rover. Both
            the major competitors don't provide any services in India. Analyzing both the applications carefully, I
            listed out some differences and their reviews from the play store.

            Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p class="cs_content pt-4">
            11pets is an application working across all the platforms. The app primarily focuses on tracking the pet’s
            health along with the giving the user remainders about pets medications and vaccinations. It also has a
            symptom monitoring system.

            Conclusion

        <p class="cs_content pt-4">
            Rover is also a cross-platform mobile application which focuses on taking care of the pet whenever the pet
            owner is away.
        </p>
        <h2 class="cs_subtitle mt-5">
            Final conclusion
        </h2>
        <p class="cs_content pt-4">
            I don’t have any intention to degrade the applications, they are best in their field and they provide
            amazing services. Moreover, by my research, I’ve found out that, these applications lag in the field of UX,
            where users find it very complicated to use the app. Finally, I would like to conclude that these
            applications don’t include services like shopping dog accessories, dog events happening nearby and feature
            to read dog blogs.

            The main goal of conducting a primary interview is to find out the problems that the pet parent is facing,
            the frustrations and the targets of the user. I interviewed around 10 pet parents to find out how are they
            managing the health of their pets, how are they booking an appointment with the doctor and how are they
            doing the accessories shopping.

            Insights from the interview
        </h2>
        <p class="cs_content pt-4">
            By conducting the primary interview, I got to know a lot more about the problems that the pet parents were
            facing. Most of the pet parents admitted that they usually forget the vaccination and the medication of
            their pets. When they drop off their pet in a pet boarding centre, they usually make sure that the pet
            boarding centre is a trusted one. In some cases, the pet parent feels a bit insecure about their pets. The
            same case when it comes to dog walkers. The pet parents also admitted that while shopping online, they
            usually don’t find their desired sized clothing for their dog. Most of the pet parent also admitted that,
            whenever any dog event happens, they usually get to know about them a bit late which usually results in them
            in lack of tickets and sometimes the bookings might also be closed by the time they get to know about the
            event.
