            museum is a treasure of such stories and poems. Museums preserve the legacy of humanity, chronicling

        <p class="cs_content mt-4"><b>The brief (by the client):</b> The experience of the museum is off. No modern
            techniques are used to make it better. This way, the museum still uses old and outdated audio guides, signs
            for explanations, and old school plans to navigate. The holders of the museum want a more intuitive and
            digital experience for the visitors that guide you easily from any point in the museum and are adaptive to
            the journey of the user.</p>
        <p class="cs_content mt-4">
            <b>Conclusions from the given brief:</b><br>
        <ul class="cs_content">
            <li>The museum didn’t have;
                any presence on the digital platform</li>
            <li>moreover, the museum used old and outdated audio guides </li>
            <li>and old school navigation plans within the museum</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2 class="cs_subtitle mt-5">Research</h2>
        <p class="cs_content mt-4">
            The digital revolution has brought with it a host of incredible opportunities for its users, and
            consequently has created a new breed of consumer. The expectations of consumers have also been transformed
            somewhere along the route. Museums are one such group striving to meet the challenges kindled by this new
            wave of digital expectations from their visitors, while at the same time struggling through both budget
            constraints and restrictive legacy systems.
        </p>
        <p class="cs_content mt-4">
            Forward-looking museums face multiple challenges in the form of visitor expectations, and it is a difficult
            task in identifying who visitors are, and what they truly want.
        </p>
        <p class="cs_content mt-4">
            A sobering fact to this is that no two visitors to a museum expect the same thing. Socio-economic
            background, age group, and digital exposure all affect visitor’s expectations. Consider the differences
            between two such groups; Millennials and Generation Z. Separated by less than twenty years, and using the
            same technologies, their priorities are so different. For example, while Millennial expect a great product,
            Gen Z would expect a great experience.
        </p>
        <ul class="cs_content mt-4">
            <li>One of the things that should be done is that they really need to figure out <b>what would make museums
                    more attractive for the audience to come and feel connected.</b> Unfortunately, even the Museums who
                have a
                lot of <b>visitor walk-ins are seemingly forgetting to acknowledge or recognize the thin line between
                    outreach and engagement.</b> These are two very different things, and museums must understand how to
                engage
                visitors (and not just children),
                perhaps constitute a visitor-run and managed committee/club, and give them the reigns! Trust is
                essential, and audiences have to be made to feel a connection with the display so they can visualize the
                links to their personal histories!</li>
            <li>
                There are still loads of museums that use <b>primarily manual billing and ticketing processes, or
                    outdated
                    applications.</b> This is crazy, especially with technology like ACME (Museum Ticketing Software |
                ACME
                Ticketing) available for museums to streamline the ticketing process.
            </li>
            <li>
                The old school way of communicating with the users in the form of maps, guides, audio guides.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="cs_content mt-4">
            A major issue here is that many museums consider that their role is still to collect, preserve, interpret,
            and display items of artistic, cultural, or scientific significance. They do not consider themselves as
            marketing or IT specialists and are reluctant to venture too far in.

        <h2 class="cs_subtitle mt-5">Research Insights</h2>
        <ul class="cs_content mt-4">
            <li>Buying tickets takes a lot of time because of the old ticketing system.</li>
            <li>People think visiting museums is boring.</li>
            <li>No digital medium or support for the museums.</li>
            <li>Museums still use manual billing and ticketing process.</li>
            <li>Old communication methods with users.</li>
            <li>No attraction for the people towards the museums.</li>

            <li>Explorers (explorers come because attending museums interests them and appeals to their curiosity)</li>
            <li>Facilitator (facilitators come because of someone else. They are perhaps bringing a friend or a group of
                people)</li>

                personal or as a tourist)</li>

            Though the client gave a problem statement, through research and interviews, we found out more problems

        <h2 class="cs_subtitle mt-5">The problem statement (main target issue)</h2>

            How might we make the museum experience more informative and interactive for the users, especially during

        <h2 class="cs_subtitle mt-5">What am I designing?</h2>
        <p class="cs_content pt-4">
            From the user research, we conclude that one of the most accessible ways of doing so would be through a
            <b>mobile application</b> with the help of a technology known as <b>Augmented Reality (AR)</b> which helps
            them access the
            museum experience easily at the comfort of their homes and also at the museum.
