        <h2 class="cs_subtitle mt-5">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="cs_content pt-4">
            Developers are gaining more awareness, involvement, and engagement within the open-source community. An
            entire community of developers creates and shares code with people all over the world. No matter what kind
            of application you’ve been involved in the 2010s, there’s a near-100 percent chance it has included some
            open source components. Developers also help in building your business online.
        </p>
        <h2 class="cs_subtitle mt-5">
            About
        </h2>
        <p class="cs_content pt-4">
            “DEV” is a mobile application that connects you with an extensive database of developers according to your
            geographical location (of radius 5km), allowing you to find developers, whether for personal projects, small
            projects, large projects, or even for small startups.
        </p>
        <h2 class="cs_subtitle mt-5">Scope of the project</h2>
        <p class="cs_content pt-4">
            Currently, there is an exciting phase going on in India’s IT space. Everyone wants to get an online presence
            in the form of a mobile application or a website, whether a small-scale industry, a large-scale industry, or
            even a common man, which means that about 7.8 billion people want to build an online presence which is
            impossible without developers. The “DEV” mobile application allows you to find developers nearby you helping
            for your projects.
        </p>
        <h2 class="cs_subtitle mt-5">Methodology</h2>
        <p class="cs_content pt-4">
            To complete this project, I used the 6D design framework. The 6D design framework involves treating each
            phase of a project as separate, distinct phases, where approval of one step is needed before the next period
            begins. The 6D design framework consists of 6 stages namely;
        </p>
        <ul class="cs_content mt-4">
            <li><b>Discover-</b> includes scope, research, and interview</li>
            <li><b>Define-</b> includes user study, persona and interview</li>
            <li><b>Dream-</b> includes scenario and information architecture</li>
            <li><b>Design-</b> includes design differentiator, paper prototype and wireframes</li>
            <li><b>Develop-</b> includes visual design, implementation, and display</li>
            <li><b>Deliver-</b> includes usability research and roadmap</li>
        </ul>

        </center>
        <h2 class="cs_subtitle mt-5">Target audience</h2>
        <p class="cs_content pt-4">
            People aged between 19 years to 45 years, technocrats, developers, founders, or CTO’s of startups, people
            who want to make an online presence, developers who need help from other developers regarding personal
            projects/ freelancing projects.

        <h2 class="cs_phase mt-5">Competitive analysis</h2>
        <h2 class="cs_subtitle mt-5">LinkedIn</h2>
        <p><b>Pros</b></p>
        <ol class="mt-4 cs_content">
            <li class="mt-4">Build trust for your brand</li>
            <p class="cs_content pt-4">
                LinkedIn is chock full of groups that are devoted to specific professional topics. Joining the groups
                helps you a lot in building your brand by promoting it. Once you are a group member, you can gain
                recognition as an authority in the field.
            </p>
            <li class="mt-4">Make meaningful business connections</li>
            <p class="cs_content pt-4">
                You get to choose whom to connect with on LinkedIn. For example, you can connect with past co-workers,
                employees, and fortune 500 executives.
            </p>
            <li class="mt-4">Establish your expertise by using the content platform</li>
            <p class="cs_content pt-4">
                LinkedIn invites users to create content, as well as posting articles on LinkedIn can help to establish
                your knowledge.
            </p>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Cons</b></p>
        <ol class="mt-4 cs_content">
            <li class="mt-4">Becoming a power user on LinkedIn requires a learning curve</li>
            <p class="cs_content pt-4">
                Like any other platform, if you want to become a LinkedIn power use, it will need you to set aside some
                time from your busy schedule and learn the ins-and-outs of the platform. A lot of tests and learn
                approaches will go into maximizing your efforts for the platform.
            </p>
            <li class="mt-4">Building a professional network is time-consuming</li>
            <p class="cs_content pt-4">
                Building a presence on LinkedIn is slow and might take some months or years for their profile to become
                helpful. You cannot play a short game on LinkedIn. If you want to make the most of LinkedIn, you have to
                play the long game and use the platform to build usability.
            </p>
            <li class="mt-4">Slow reaction time by LinkedIn Support</li>
            <p class="cs_content pt-4">
                People who have reached out to LinkedIn for help and support also complain that LinkedIn is slow to
                react. Even though I agree that slow customer service can lead to unhappy users, but we need to
                understand that LinkedIn offers a free access platform for everyone, and having free access to hundreds
                and millions of users can lead to an imbalance. </p>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="cs_subtitle mt-5">Freelancer</h2>
        <p><b>Pros</b></p>
        <ol class="mt-4 cs_content">
            <li class="mt-4">Control over jobs and clients</li>
            <p class="cs_content pt-4">
                When you work for someone else, you don’t get a choice of whom you work with. You can become stuck with
                unprofessional or rude clients. But, when you are a freelancer, you can choose with whom you work.
            </p>
            <li class="mt-4">Flexible hours</li>
            <p class="cs_content pt-4">
                The main advantage of being a freelancer is that you can work whenever and wherever you want. You get to
                choose your boss. As a freelancer, you can work during your most productive hours.
            </p>
            <li class="mt-4">You are the boss</li>
            <p class="cs_content pt-4">
                You no longer have to answer to anyone but your clients and yourself. No one is hanging over you or
                micromanaging you. You are free to do as making all the tough decisions just because it is your
                responsibility; you have all the control.
            </p>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Cons</b></p>
        <ol class="mt-4 cs_content">
            <li class="mt-4">Commission</li>
            <p class="cs_content pt-4">
                Platforms like freelance.com take around 20% of your payment when you find work on their platform. These
                hurt because, with high competition on their platforms, it drives down your profits and rupee per hour.
            </p>
            <li class="mt-4">Spam</li>
            <p class="cs_content pt-4">
                Though there are thousands of works available on the platform, most of the works are spam. You can see
                that their jobs are so high, or the client doesn’t have any rating and experience. Waiting for this
                opportunity, you might miss some genuine work opportunities.
            </p>
            <li class="mt-4">Competition</li>
            <p class="cs_content pt-4">
                Freelancer has high competition, with more than 20 freelancers fighting for the same opportunity.
                However, only one freelancer will be selected, a lot of competition leads to low baller that brings the
                value of work and the freelancer down to unreasonable rates. </p>

            A persona is a user-centered design is a fictional character created to represent a user type that might use

            After I collected all the inputs from the target audience, I listed out all the features that could be in
